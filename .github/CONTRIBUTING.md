# Contributing

The various `terraform-*-hvd` modules are public and open to community contributors.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Do note that this project has a code of conduct; please be sure to follow it
in all of your project interactions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build artifacts are removed before the end of
   the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md, any relevant `./docs/`entry or `./examples` with details of changes to the
   interface, this includes running `terraform-docs` to update the `README.md`
3. Releases use versioning tags. The versioning scheme we use is (mostly) [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other
   project contributors, or if you do not have permission to do that, you can
   request the second reviewer to merge it for you and release.

## Issues

There is a basic issue template to post issues.

## Pull-request

The repo includes a pull-request template with basic requirments for testing and validation which we provide config for basic smoke test such as `terarform fmt, validate` and `terraform-docs`


## Tooling

This repository uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) to manage development tasks.

### Requirements

The `release` task requires;

- Make sure you have Task installed before proceeding, <https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation>.
- This also relies on the GitHub cli `GH`, <https://cli.github.com/>, do not forget to authenticate `gh`
- The `markdown-url-converter.py` requires `python` in your `$PATH`.

## Available Tasks

You can list all available tasks by running:

```bash
task
task default
task --list-all
```

## Testing

To run all tests:

```bash
task test
```

This will run Terraform tests:
- `task test-terraform`: Runs formatting checks, initialization, and validation for all Terraform directories

## Cleaning

To clean the environment:

```bash
task clean
```

This includes:
- `task clean-terraform`: Removes Terraform directories and lock files

## Documentation

To update Terraform documentation:

```bash
task terraform-docs
```

Note: This requires a `.terraform-docs.yml` configuration file. If you don't have one, you can generate it with:

```bash
task generate-terraform-docs-config
```

## Creating a Release

To create a new release, once a feature branch as been merged from pull request.

```bash
MOD_RELEASE=X.Y.Z task release
```

Requirements:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed
- Python must be in the PATH:
- `MOD_RELEASE` variable must be set to a valid semver tag (e.g., `1.2.3`), it can be set as an env var `export MOD_RELEASE`, in `env.local`, or passsed at the command line `MOD_RELEASE=x.x.x. task release`
- The new version must be greater than the current tag

The release process will:
1. Create a release branch
2. Update documentation URLs
3. Create a tagged release
4. Generate release notes
5. Create a GitHub release
6. Clean up the temporary release branch

```
MOD_RELEASE=0.1.2 task release -n
task: [release] export MOD_REPO="terraform-<provider>-<product>-hvd"
export MOD_RELEASE="0.1.2"
export REPO_OWNER="hashicorp"
echo "Releasing hashicorp/terraform-<provider>-<product>-hvd version 0.1.2"

task: [release] git checkout -b rel-${MOD_RELEASE}
task: [release] python .github/scripts/markdown-url-converter/markdown-url-converter.py --repo="hashicorp/terraform-<provider>-<product>-hvd" --release="0.1.2" --overwrite .

task: [release] git commit  --allow-empty -am "Release version ${MOD_RELEASE}"
task: [release] git tag -a ${MOD_RELEASE} -m "${MOD_RELEASE} release"
task: [release] git revert HEAD --no-edit
task: [release] git push origin --tags
task: [release] git push origin rel-${MOD_RELEASE}
task: [release] gh release create 0.1.2 \
--repo hashicorp/terraform-<provider>-<product>-hvd \
--title "0.1.2" \
--generate-notes --verify-tag

task: [release] git push origin --delete rel-${MOD_RELEASE}
```

> You can also set the `MOD_RELEASE` variable in a `.env.local` file for convenience.
